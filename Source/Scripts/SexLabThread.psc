	Tags are used to further describe a scene, they have different scopes:
		- ThreadTags combine tags shared by every scene the thread has been initiaited with, Example: if we have 2 scenes: 
				["doggy", "loving", "behind"] and ["doggy", "loving", "hugging", "kissing"], then the thread tags will be ["doggy", "loving"]
		- SceneTags describe the playing scene loosely, for each tag there is at least one stage that uses it
		- StageTags only describe the currently playing stage
